##  *Introduction*
This project is the software development 3rd Year IT Practice Project. 
</br>
Diary Application 
</br>
There is a login page, registration page. When you regist success then will go to a ‘Welcome’ page for 3 seconds , then jump to diary page for user to write their diary and can list their diary title and can also delete and edit it.

## *Service Side TechnologiesSpring Framework*
 
 Spring Framework

The Spring Framework provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications – on any kind of deployment platform. A key element of Spring is infrastructure support at the application level: Spring focuses on the “plumbing” of enterprise applications so that programmers can focus on application-level business logic, without unnecessary ties to specific deployment envitonments. 

  Features
  *	Dependency Injection and control flow 

  *	Spring MVC web application 

  *	Foundational support for JDBC, JPA 

  *	And more…

## *Desirable functionalities*
*	Add the Research function for user can easier to find their diary.

*	Add emai validate and if user forgot their password they can use their email address to find their password and also can reset their password.

*	Deploy this project to the aws (cloud) so that can use it anywhere.

## *Conclusions*

During this project development, I was able to find a use of our knowledge obtained from previous years modules, this semester modules, as well as learning new technologies not covered on a course. 

From this experience, I have concluded that it is worth spending more time in researching Spring framework capabilities, as it can provide much more fundament for an application development. 
Spring framework became my favorite Java Framework to develop with and I would definatly consider to develop other projects using it.
